### Exercises 1.1-3
***
Consider the **searching problem**:
<insert image>
Write pseudocode for **linear search**, which scans through the sequence, looking for *v*. Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.

### `Answer`
Singly Linked List with Head & Tail Pointers
* O(1) efficiency with adding/removing element to head or tail of the list
* O(n) efficiency with adding/removing element within the list
* Less storage due to only being singly linked (one direction)
* Lacks ability to traverse in the opposite direction
* Typical applications: Stack & Queues

### Exercises 2.1-4
***
Consider the problem of adding two *n*-bit binary integers, stored in two *n*-elemnt arrays *A* and *B*. The sum of the two integers should be stored in binary form in an (*n* + 1)-element array *C*. State the problem formally and write pseudocode for adding the two integers.

### `Answer`
