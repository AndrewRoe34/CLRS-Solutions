### Exercises 1.2-1
***
Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

### `Answer`
A good example is an automated schedule generator. Core functionality is listed below:
* Sort tasks by priority (number of hours and due date)
* Ability to quickly retrieve a task
* Add/Remove tasks with minimal performance impact

### Exercises 1.2-2
***
